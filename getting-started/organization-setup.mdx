### Organization Naming Conventions

- **Legal Compliance**: Use your organization's registered legal name for contracts and invoices
- **Brand Consistency**: Match your name across all platforms (website, social media, etc.)
- **Example**:
  - ❌ "TechConf 2024" (Too specific to one event)
  - ✅ "Global Technology Foundation" (Official name)
  - ✅ "GTF Events" (Commonly used abbreviation)

#### Technical Considerations
- **Character Limits**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Special Characters**: Avoid using:
  - Quotation marks (", ')
  - Special symbols (@, #, $, etc.)
  - Emojis or non-standard characters
- **Case Sensitivity**: The system is case-sensitive but displays consistently

1. **Automatic Backups**
   - Enable daily database backups
   - Store backups for minimum 90 days
   - Test restoration process quarterly

2. **Manual Exports**
   - Export attendee lists after major events
   - Download financial reports monthly
   - Archive old events annually

### Security Best Practices
