# Creating and Managing Ticket Types

Learn how to create and manage different types of tickets for your events using Loft's powerful ticketing system.

## Creating a New Ticket Type

1. Navigate to your event dashboard
2. Click on **Tickets** in the left sidebar
3. Click **+ Add Ticket Type**
4. Fill in the ticket details:
   - **Ticket Name**: General Admission, VIP, Early Bird, etc.
   - **Description**: What's included with this ticket
   - **Price**: Set the ticket price (or mark as free)
   - **Quantity Available**: Total number of tickets for this type
   - **Sales Start/End**: When the tickets will be available for purchase

## Ticket Type Settings

### Visibility Options
- **Public**: Visible to everyone
- **Password Protected**: Requires a password to view/purchase
- **Hidden**: Only accessible via direct link

### Sales Restrictions
- Set purchase limits per customer
- Require promo codes for access
- Restrict to specific customer groups

### Advanced Options
- Set ticket delivery method (e-ticket, will-call, etc.)
- Configure ticket transfer settings
- Set up automated email confirmations

## Managing Existing Ticket Types

### Editing Ticket Types
1. Go to the Tickets section of your event
2. Click the **Edit** button next to the ticket type
3. Make your changes and click **Save**

### Pausing Sales
Temporarily stop sales for a ticket type without deleting it.

### Archiving Tickets
Remove old ticket types from public view while keeping the sales data.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Be clear and descriptive
- Include important details (e.g., "VIP - Front Row Access")
- Keep names concise but informative

### Pricing Strategy
- Consider early bird pricing
- Create tiered pricing for different attendee types
- Include fees in your pricing considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Tickets not appearing**: Check visibility and sales date settings
- **Pricing errors**: Verify currency and fee settings
- **Capacity issues**: Ensure you haven't reached your ticket limits
