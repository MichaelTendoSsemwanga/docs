## Best Practices for Team Management

### Role Assignment

- Use the **Notes** field to document role-specific responsibilities

### Security

- Regularly review and revoke access for inactive team members
- Use **SSO** (Single Sign-On) if available for your organization

### Communication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Incorrect permissions?** Verify the user's role and adjust as needed
- **Can't see certain features?** The user's role may not have access to those features
